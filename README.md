# [Snake](https://sp4r0w.itch.io/snake)
## A clone of the classic Snake game made in Godot

### Description
-------------
This is a small project we made in Godot 4 as a sort of comeback after a long break. <br>
It's a simple Snake remake - very simple, but easy enough to remember all the coding rules.<br>
The project itself is also a remake of the old Solar2D version. <br>
It looks more appealing visually and is also better in terms of functionality. <br>

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot v4.3. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.

### Installation
- This game is playable on the [Itch](https://sp4r0w.itch.io/snake) page.
- You can also [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or download the repository and play it through Godot Editor.
